Initially hailed as a genius due to a strong soul and fast Dou Qi absorption rate, he experienced a significant setback three years prior, losing his ability to cultivate Dou Qi, and is now considered a fallen genius at the age of fourteen (though at some points referred to as fifteen). He wears a black ring given to him by his deceased mother, which emits a faint light and houses a voice/old man, later revealed to be Yao Lao, his teacher, who has been absorbing his Dou Qi.  He is struggling with this loss of ability, particularly as he faces an impending adulthood ceremony that could determine his future within the Xiao family. He is currently at the third stage of Dou Qi cultivation.\n\nXiao Yan is facing pressure and humiliation due to an arranged marriage with \u7eb3\u5170\u5ae3\u7136 (Nalan Yanran), which she comes to annul.  He displays a complex range of emotions, from anger and outrage to calculated restraint, leveraging family traditions to oppose the annulment. Ultimately, he terminates the engagement, vowing to surpass Nalan Yanran in three years.  His father considers him unworthy of Nalan Yanran due to his perceived mediocre talent.\n\nXiao Yan is determined to regain his strength and improve his fighting abilities, seeking a powerful fire attribute cultivation technique and showing curiosity, frustration, and determination in his pursuit. He is concerned about the cost of the training materials and his dwindling funds, demonstrating the importance of money in the Dou Qi continent.  He interacts with Yao Lao, initially with anger upon discovering the source of his lost Dou Qi, but later accepts his help. He is also shown practicing cultivation, seeking ways to improve his abilities. He is a young aspiring alchemist, initially skeptical, but eager to learn from Yao Lao, showing respect and a desire for mastery.\n\nXiao Yan is close to \u718f\u513f (Xun Er) and has secretly helped her in the past. He apologizes to her for his past behavior, borrows money from her, and interacts with her playfully and affectionately, demonstrating that he has regained his confidence and grown from his past setbacks. He is also curious about Xun Er\u0027s mysterious background and questions her about Nalan Yanran\u0027s actions.  He accompanies Xun Er to purchase medicinal ingredients.
